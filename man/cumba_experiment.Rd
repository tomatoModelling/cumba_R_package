\title{the CUMBA model}
\usage{
cumba_experiment(
  weather,
  param,
  estimateRad = T,
  estimateET0 = T,
  irrigation_df
)
}
\arguments{
\item{weather}{a dataframe with weather data which must have the following columns......}

\item{param}{a dataframe with model parameters values}

\item{estimateRad}{a boolean value to estimate solar radiation based on temperature using Hargreaves model. Default to 'true' (implying that the column Lat is present in weather df) if 'false' the 'weather' df must have the Rad column}

\item{estimateET0}{a boolean value to estimate reference evapotranspiration based on temperature using Hargreaves model. Default to 'true'}

\item{irrigation_df}{a dataframe containing the irrigation scheduling for each experiment defined in the weather dataframe.}
}
\value{
a dataframe containing the weatherDf plus the daily outputs of the cumba model
}
\description{
It is a daily time step simulation model which computes the yield and brix degree of a tomato crop as a function of weather data and irrigation options.
